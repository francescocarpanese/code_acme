# code-acme

**C**ontrol **O**rdinary **D**ifferential **E**quations using Deepmind [acme](https://github.com/deepmind/acme) framework. 

The purposes of code-acme package are: 
*   Implement simple physics environments, based on ode, to investigate continous action space control with deep reinforcement learning. 
*   Provide implementation examples of custom environments in [dm-control](https://github.com/deepmind/dm_control) framework.
*   Provide examples of using [acme](https://github.com/deepmind/acme) framework to train deep reinforcement learning agent for continuous action space control.

The implemented environments are meant to be lightwise to enable training with limited computational resources.
